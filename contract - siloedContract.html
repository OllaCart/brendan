                <h3>Titles, Surveys, and Costs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Within ${titleCoDays} days from the Execution Date of this Agreement, Buyer will order from a reputable title company for delivery to Seller a comprehensive title report on 
                        the Property. Upon receipt, Buyer will deliver a free copy of the title report to Seller.</li>
                    <li>Buyer is encouraged to obtain an owner’s title insurance policy to protect Buyer. An owner’s title insurance policy is different from a lender’s title insurance 
                        policy, which will not protect Buyer from claims and attacks on the title. Owner’s title insurance policies come in standard and enhanced versions; Buyer should 
                        consult with a title insurance agent about Buyer’s options. Buyer agrees to release and discharge any and all claims and losses against Broker for Buyer should 
                        Buyer neglect to obtain an owner’s title insurance policy.</li>
                    <li>Buyer will pay for the following: (1) Title search, title insurance and/or mechanics’ lien insurance, or any fee for cancellation; (2) Flood insurance, fire 
                        insurance, hazard insurance, mine subsidence insurance, or any fee for cancellation; (3) Appraisal fees and charges paid in advance to mortgage lender; (4) 
                        Buyer’s customary settlement costs and accruals.</li>
                    <li>Any survey or surveys required by the title insurance company or the abstracting company for preparing an adequate legal description of the Property (or 
                        the correction thereof) will be obtained and paid for by Seller. Any survey or surveys desired by Buyer or required by the mortgage lender will be obtained 
                        and paid for by Buyer.</li>
                    <li>The Property will be conveyed with good and marketable title that is insurable by a reputable title insurance company at the regular rates, free and clear 
                        of all liens, encumbrances, and easements, excepting however the following: existing deed restrictions; historic preservation restrictions or ordinances; 
                        building restrictions; ordinances; easements of roads; easements visible upon the ground; easements of record; and privileges or rights of public service 
                        companies, if any.</li>
                    <li>If a change in Seller’s financial status affects Seller’s ability to convey title to the Property on or before the Settlement Date, or any extension thereof, 
                        Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing. A change in financial status includes, but is not limited to, Seller filing bankruptcy; filing of a foreclosure 
                        lawsuit against the Property; entry of a monetary judgment against Seller; notice of public tax sale affecting the Property; and Seller learning that the sale 
                        price of the Property is no longer sufficient to satisfy all liens and encumbrances against the Property.</li>
                    <li>If Seller is unable to give good and marketable title that is insurable by a reputable title insurance company at the regular rates, Buyer may terminate this 
                        Agreement by written notice to Seller, with all deposit monies returned to Buyer according to the terms of this Agreement, or take such title 
                        as Seller can convey. If the title condition precludes Seller from conveying title, Buyer’s sole remedy shall be to terminate this Agreement. Upon termination, 
                        all deposit monies shall be returned to Buyer according to the terms of this Agreement and Seller will reimburse Buyer for any costs incurred 
                        by Buyer for any inspections or certifications obtained according to the terms of this Agreement.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Notices, Assessments, and Municipal Requirements</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the event any notices of public and/or private assessments are received after Seller has signed this Agreement and before settlement, Seller will within 
                        ${inspectNegotiationDays} days of receiving the notices and/or assessments provide a copy of the notices and/or assessments to Buyer and will notify Buyer in 
                        writing that Seller will:</li>
                        <ol>

                             income tax withholding. FIRPTA authorized the United States to tax foreign persons on dispositions of U.S. real property interests. This includes but is not 
                             limited to a sale or exchange, liquidation, redemption, gift, transfers, etc. Persons purchasing U.S. real property interests (transferee) from foreign 
                             persons, certain purchasers’ agents, and settlement officers are required to withhold up to 15 percent of the amount realized (special rules for foreign 
                             corporations). Withholding is intended to ensure U.S. taxation of gains realized on disposition of such interests. The transferee/Buyer is the withholding 
                             agent. If you are the transferee/Buyer you must find out if the transferor is a foreign person as defined by the Act. If the transferor is a foreign person 
                             and you fail to withhold, you may be held liable for the tax.</li>

                                property taxes as the amount of property taxes that the buyer may be obligated to
                                pay in the year subsequent to purchase. A change of ownership or property
                                improvements triggers reassessments of the property that could result in higher
                                property taxes. If you have any questions concerning valuation, contact the
                                county property appraiser’s office for information.</li>

                                for reissue of coverage; (B) tax search; and (C) municipal lien search. Buyer shall obtain and pay for post-Closing

                            stated in this agreement (or any written extensions thereof) or following termination of the Agreement, whichever is earlier, then the Broker 
                            holding the deposit monies will, within 30 days of receipt of Buyer's written request, distribute the deposit monies to Buyer unless the Broker 
                            is in receipt of verifiable written notice that the dispute is the subject of litigation or mediation. If Broker has received verifiable written

                            that the distribution of deposit monies based upon the passage of time does not legally determine entitlement to deposit monies, and that the 
                            parties maintain their legal rights to pursue litigation even after a distribution is made.</li>

                    <h3>Mediation</h3>

                        <li>Buyer and Seller will submit all disputes or claims that arise from this Agreement, including disputes and claims over deposit monies, to mediation. 
                            Mediation will be conducted in accordance with the Rules and Procedures of the Home Sellers/Home Buyers Dispute Resolution System, unless it is not 
                            available, in which case Buyer and Seller will mediate according to the terms of the mediation system offered or endorsed by the local Association of 
                            Realtors™. Mediation fees, contained in the mediator’s fee schedule, will be divided equally among the parties and will be paid before the mediation 
                            conference. Legal proceedings may be initiated prior to the completion of the mediation process to stop any statute of limitations from expiring and 
                            for the purpose of indexing a lis pendens by Buyer to prevent the transfer of title to a third party when Buyer is seeking to purchase the Property. 
                            The parties agree that all proceedings shall be stayed until the completion of mediation and that a court of competent jurisdiction may award attorneys'
                            fees to the prevailing party should the court find that a party has unreasonably breached this provision or acted in bad faith. Any agreement reached 
                            through mediation and signed by the parties will be binding. Any agreement to mediate disputes or claims arising from this Agreement will survive settlement.</li>
