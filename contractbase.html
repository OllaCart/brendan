<br /><p><strong>8. BUYER FINANCING</strong></p>
<ol><li>Buyer may elect to make this Agreement contingent upon obtaining mortgage financing. Regardless of any contingency in this Agreement, if Buyer chooses to obtain mortgage financing, the following terms apply:</li>
<ol>
<li>Buyer will be in default of this Agreement if Buyer furnishes false information to anyone concerning Buyer’s financial and/or employment status, fails to cooperate in good faith with processing the mortgage loan application (including payment for and ordering of appraisal without delay), fails to lock in interest rate(s) as stated below, or otherwise causes the lender to reject, or refuse to approve or issue, a mortgage loan.</li>
<li>Within 7 days from the Execution Date of this Agreement, Buyer will make a completed mortgage application (including payment for and ordering of credit reports without delay) for the mortgage terms and to the mortgage lender(s) identified in Paragraph 8(6), if any, otherwise to a responsible mortgage lender(s) of Buyer’s choice. Broker for Buyer, if any, otherwise Broker for Seller, is authorized to communicate with the mortgage lender(s) to assist in the mortgage loan process. Broker for Seller, if any, is permitted to contact the mortgage lender(s) at any time to determine the status of the mortgage loan application.</li>
<li>Seller will provide access to insurers’ representatives and, as may be required by the mortgage lender(s), to surveyors, municipal officials, appraisers, and inspectors.</li>
<li>If the mortgage lender(s) gives Buyer the right to lock in interest rate(s) at or below the maximum levels desired, Buyer will do so at least 10 days before Settlement Date.</li>
<li>If the mortgage lender(s), or a property and casualty insurer providing insurance required by the mortgage lender(s), requires repairs to the Property, Buyer will, upon receiving the requirements, deliver a copy of the requirements to Seller. Within 7 days of receiving the copy of the requirements, Seller will notify Buyer whether Seller will make the required repairs at Seller’s expense.</li><ol>
<li>If Seller makes the required repairs to the satisfaction of the mortgage lender and/or insurer, Buyer accepts the Property and agrees to the RELEASE in Paragraph 28 of this Agreement.</li>
<li>If Seller will not make the required repairs, or if Seller fails to respond within the stated time, Buyer will, within 7 Days, notify Seller of Buyer’s choice to:</li><ol>
<li>Make the repairs/improvements at Buyer’s expense, with permission and access to the Property given by Seller, which will not be unreasonably withheld (Seller may require that Buyer sign a pre-settlement possession agreement such as the Pre-Settlement Possession Addendum, which shall not, in and of itself, be considered unreasonable), OR</li>
<li>Terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller, with all deposit monies returned to Buyer according to the terms of Paragraph 26 of this Agreement.</li>
<li>If Buyer fails to respond within the time stated above or fails to terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller within that time, Buyer will accept the Property, make the required repairs/improvements at Buyer’s expense and agree to the RELEASE in Paragraph 28 of this Agreement.</li></ol>
<li>The Loan-To-Value ratio (LTV) is used by lenders as one tool to help assess their potential risk of a mortgage loan. A particular LTV may be necessary to qualify for certain loans, or buyers might be required to pay additional fees if the LTV exceeds a specific level. The appraised value of the Property may be used by lenders to determine the maximum amount of a mortgage loan. The appraised value is determined by an independent appraiser, subject to the mortgage lender’s underwriter review, and may be higher or equal to the Purchase Price and/or market price of the Property.</li></ol>
<li>Mortgage Contingency</li>
<ul><li> This sale is NOT contingent on mortgage financing, although Buyer may obtain mortgage financing and/or the parties may include an appraisal contingency. Buyer and Seller understand that the waiver of this contingency does not restrict Buyer’s right to obtain mortgage financing for the Property.</li>
<li>This sale is contingent upon Buyer obtaining mortgage financing according to the terms outlined below. Upon receiving documentation demonstrating the mortgage lender’s approval, whether conditional or outright, of Buyer’s mortgage application(s) according to the following terms, Buyer will promptly deliver a copy of the documentation to Seller, but in any case no later than ${commitmentDate} (Commitment Date).</li><ul>
<li>Proposed First Mortgage</li><ul>
<li>Loan Amount:$${loanAmount}.</li>
<li>Minimum Term: ${mortgageTerm}  years.</li>
<li>Proposed LTV: ${proposedLTV}%.</li>
<li>Mortgage Lender: ${mortgageLender}.</li>
<li>Interest Rate: ${interestRate}%.</li>
<li>Buyer agrees to accept the interest rate as may be committed by the mortgage lender.</li>
<li>Discount points, loan origination, loan placement and other fees charged by the lender as a percentage of the mortgage loan (excluding any mortgage insurance premiums or VA funding fee) not to exceed 3% of the mortgage loan amount.</li></ul>
<ol><li>The interest rate(s) and fee(s) provisions are satisfied if the mortgage lender(s) gives Buyer the right to guarantee the interest rate(s) and fee(s).</li>
<li>Buyer gives Seller the right, at Seller’s sole option and as permitted by law and the mortgage lender(s), to contribute financially, without promise of reimbursement, to Buyer and/or the mortgage lender(s) to make the above mortgage term(s) available to Buyer.</li>
<li>Seller may terminate this Agreement after the Commitment Date by written notice to Buyer if:</li><ol>
<li>Seller does not receive a copy of the documentation demonstrating the mortgage lender’s conditional or outright approval of Buyer’s mortgage application(s) by the Commitment Date, OR</li>
<li> The documentation demonstrating the mortgage lender’s conditional or outright approval of Buyer’s mortgage application(s) contains any condition not specified in this Agreement (e.g., Buyer must settle on another property, an appraisal must be received by the lender, or the approval is not valid through the Settlement Date) that is not satisfied and/or removed in writing by the mortgage lender(s) within ${lenderContingency} after the Commitment Date, or any extension thereof, other than those conditions that are customarily satisfied at or near settlement (e.g., obtaining insurance, confirming employment, verifying housing history).</li></ol>
<li> Seller’s right to terminate continues until Buyer delivers documentation demonstrating the mortgage lender’s conditional or outright approval of Buyer’s mortgage application(s) to Seller. Until Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph, Buyer must continue to make a good faith effort to obtain mortgage financing. Termination of this Agreement by Buyer due to the mortgage lender’s denial of Buyer’s mortgage application(s) may demonstrate bad faith by Buyer and result in the forfeiture of deposit monies to Seller.</li>
<li>If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Paragraph 8(6)(2), or the mortgage loan(s) is not obtained for settlement, all deposit monies will be returned to Buyer according to the terms of Paragraph 26 and this Agreement will be VOID. Buyer will be responsible for any costs incurred by Buyer for any inspections or certifications obtained according to the terms of this Agreement, and any costs incurred by Buyer for: (A) Title search, title insurance and/or mechanics’ lien insurance, or any fee for cancellation; (B) Flood insurance, fire insurance, hazard insurance, mine subsidence insurance, or any fee for cancellation; (C) Appraisal fees and charges paid in advance to mortgage lender(s).</li></ol>

Buyer will have the privilege and option of proceeding with consummation of the contract without regard to the amount of the appraised valuation.

<p> Rights and Responsibilities</p>

<li>For elected Inspection(s), Buyer will, within the Contingency Period stated in Paragraph 13(A), complete Inspections, obtain any Inspection Reports or results (referred to as “Report” or “Reports”), and accept the Property, terminate this Agreement, or submit a written corrective proposal to Seller, according to the terms of Paragraph 13(B).</li>
</ol>

<br /><p>HOME/PROPERTY INSPECTIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS</p>
<p>Buyer may conduct an inspection of the Property’s structural components; roof; exterior windows and exterior doors; exterior building material, fascia, gutters and downspouts; swimming pools, hot tubs and spas; appliances; electrical systems; interior and exterior plumbing; public sewer systems; heating and cooling systems; water penetration; electromagnetic fields; wetlands and flood plain delineation; structure square footage; mold and other environmental hazards (e.g., fungi, indoor air quality, asbestos, underground storage tanks, etc.); and any other items Buyer may select. If Buyer elects to have a home inspection of the Property, as defined in the Home Inspection Law, the home inspection must be performed by a full member in good standing of a national home inspection association, or a person supervised by a full member of a national home inspection association, in accordance with the ethical standards and code of conduct or practice of that association, or by a properly licensed or registered engineer or architect. (See Notices Regarding Property & Environmental Inspections)</p>
<ol><li>Wood Infestation</li><p>Buyer may obtain a written “Wood-Destroying Insect Infestation Inspection Report” from an inspector certified as a wood-destroying pests pesticide applicator and will deliver it and all supporting documents and drawings provided by the inspector to Seller. The Report is to be made satisfactory to and in compliance with applicable laws, mortgage lender requirements, and/or Federal Insuring and Guaranteeing Agency requirements. The Inspection is to be limited to all readily-visible and accessible areas of all structures on the Property, except fences. If the Inspection reveals active infestation(s), Buyer, at Buyer’s expense, may obtain a Proposal from a wood-destroying pests pesticide applicator to treat the Property. If the Inspection reveals damage from active or previous infestation(s), Buyer may obtain a written Report from a professional contractor, home inspector or structural engineer that is limited to structural damage to the Property caused by wood-destroying organisms and a Proposal to repair the Property.</p>
<li>Deeds, Restrictions and Zoning</li><p>Buyer may investigate easements, deed and use restrictions (including any historic preservation restrictions or ordinances) that apply to the Property and review local zoning ordinances. Buyer may verify that the present use of the Property (such as in-law quarters, apartments, home office, day care, commercial or recreational vehicle parking, short-term rentals) is permitted and may elect to make the Agreement contingent upon an anticipated use.</p>
<li>Water Service</li><p>Elected Buyer may obtain an Inspection of the quality and quantity of the water system from a properly licensed or other- Waived wise qualified water/well testing company. If and as required by the inspection company, Seller, at Seller’s expense, will locate and provide access to the on-site (or individual) water system. Seller will restore the Property to its previous condition, at Seller’s expense, prior to settlement.</p>
<li>Radon</li><p>Elected Buyer may obtain a radon test of the Property from a certified inspector. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Waived (EPA) advises corrective action if the average annual exposure to radon is equal to or higher than 0.02 working levels or 4 picoCuries/liter (4pCi/L). Radon is a natural, radioactive gas that is produced in the ground by the normal decay of uranium and radium. Studies indicate that extended exposure to high levels of radon gas can increase the risk of lung cancer. Radon can find its way into any air-space and can permeate a structure. If a house has a radon problem, it usually can be cured by increased ventilation and/or by preventing radon entry. Any person who tests, mitigates or safeguards a building for radon in <span>${Address.state}</span> must be certified by the Department of Environmental Protection. </p>
<li>Sewage System</li><p>Buyer may obtain an Inspection of the individual on-lot sewage disposal system, which may include a hydraulic load Waived test, from a qualified, professional inspector. If and as required by the inspection company, Seller, at Seller’s expense, will locate, provide access to, empty the individual on-lot sewage disposal system and provide all water needed, unless otherwise agreed. Seller will restore the Property to its previous condition, at Seller’s expense, prior to settlement. See Paragraph 13(3) for more information regarding the Individual On-lot Sewage Inspection Contingency.</p>
<li>Property and Flood Insurance</li><p>Buyer may determine the insurability of the Property by making application for property and casualty insurance for the Property to a responsible insurer. Broker for Buyer, if any, otherwise Broker for Seller, may communicate with the insurer to assist in the insurance process. If the Property is located in a specially-designated flood zone, Buyer may be required to carry flood insurance at Buyer’s expense, which may need to be ordered 14 days or more prior to Settlement Date. Revised flood maps and changes to Federal law may substantially increase future flood insurance premiums or require insurance for formerly exempt properties. Buyer should consult with one or more flood insurance agents regarding the need for flood insurance and possible premium increases.</p>
<li>Property Boundaries</li><p>Buyer may engage the services of a surveyor, title abstractor, or other qualified professional to assess the legal Waived description, certainty and location of boundaries and/or quantum of land. Most sellers have not had the Property surveyed as it is not a requirement of property transfer in <span>${Address.state}</span>. Any fences, hedges, walls and other natural or constructed barriers may or may not represent the true boundary lines of the Property. Any numerical representations of size of property are approximations only and may be inaccurate</p>
<li>Lead-Based Paint Hazards (For Properties built prior to 1978 only)</li><p> Before Buyer is obligated to purchase a residential dwelling built prior to 1978, Buyer has the option to conduct a risk assessment and/or inspection of the Property for the presence of lead-based paint and/or lead-based paint hazards. Regardless of whether this inspection is elected or waived, the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act requires a seller of property built prior to 1978 to provide the Buyer with an EPA-approved lead hazards information pamphlet titled “Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home,” along with a separate form, attached to this Agreement, disclosing Seller’s knowledge of lead-based paint hazards and any lead-based paint records regarding the Property.</p>

<ul><li>Notices Regarding Property & Environmental Inspections</li>
<li>Exterior Building Materials: Poor or improper installation of exterior building materials may result in moisture penetrating the surface of a structure where it may cause mold and damage to the building’s frame.</li>
